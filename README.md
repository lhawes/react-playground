## Hot loading
Most of the time, you will be able to add/edit/remove in the react app with a live reload throught the React Hot Loader. There are some situations where you will need to refresh, but almost none where you have to restart node.

*There is no distribution directory*. Everything is held in memory by the react hot loader middleware.

## TODO
* Add Axios example
* Add React Routing
* Add built in Component Method examples
* Add in Redux examples
* Add in flux examples
* Add in Mobx examples
* Add docs fro examples
